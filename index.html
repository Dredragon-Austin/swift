        <p>In the modern day, having some sort of experience coding is essential for the real world. This is because you
          use it in your everyday life and is key to mastering the realm of the internet. In all honestly, Im no
          professional within this sector however I have some experience when it comes to programming such as using
          popular web languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>

        <p>Video Editing is also another sought-after skill due to its high expectations and the concentration which is
          required to master the art of a good video. This is something which I have been perfecting throughout my
          career and which to embark and develop even further. Giving you guys high quality content when you need to be

        <p>This is more of a personal preference. Love to play enjoyable games with constant updates. Always finding new
          ways to change and modify the ones I love. Sometimes this gets out of hand, so it has to come in moderation.
          Has a ton of fun playing games such as Bloxd.io and Eaglercraft. If anyone has any good sandbox games let me
          know.</p>
